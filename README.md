# JavaScript Console-Finances App

This is a basic javaScript practice activity to log finances to console. This is done from a 2d array containing [type-string, type-int], and will work for on other datasets of the same type by changing the calculateFinances() argument to the new array by the function call at the bottom of script.js.

This was a good brush-up on javaScript as it has been a while since I have written any real javaScript logic. With more time, I would find ways to better refactor the code and make it cleaner.
